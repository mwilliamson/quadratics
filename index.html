        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>
          Linear equations are made up of two different types of terms:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Variables, such as $$ x $$.
            They might be multiplied by a number e.g. $$ -2x $$, $$ \frac{3}{4} x $$.
          </li>
          <li>
            Constants, such as $$ 6 $$, $$ -19 $$, or $$ \frac{1}{2} $$.
            In other words, a single number.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          By putting these pieces together, we can make linear equations:
        </p>
        
        $$$
          \begin{equation*}
          \begin{split}
            2x + 4 & = 0 \\
            3x - 9 & = 16 \\
            6x - 4 & = x + 2 \\
            -4x & = 5 \\
          \end{split}
          \end{equation*}
        $$$
        
        <p>
          Quadratic equations are made up of the same terms as linear equations,
          plus one more: a variable squared, such as $$x^2$$.
          Using this extra piece, we can make quadratic equations:
        </p>
        
        $$$
          \begin{equation*}
          \begin{split}
            x^2 + 3x + 2 & = 0 \\
            x^2 - 4x & = 12 \\
            4x^2 & = 0 \\
            -3x^2 + 27 & = 54 \\
          \end{split}
          \end{equation*}
        $$$
        
        <h2>Visualising quadratic equations</h2>
        
        <p>
          We can visualise linear equations by plotting one side of the equation on a graph.
          For instance, if we have $$ 2x + 4 = 5 - 3x $$, we can visualise the
          left-hand side by plotting $$ y = 2x + 4 $$.
        </p>
        
        <div class="interactive" data-interact-name="single-linear-equation">
          <p><span class="action">(randomise)</span></p>
          <p><span data-display="equation"></span></p>
        
          <div class="graph">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          If we plot both sides of a linear equation, then the solution for $$ x $$
          is the $$ x $$ coordinate where the lines meet. For instance,
          if we have the equation $$ 2x + 4 = 5 - 3x $$, we can plot
          $$ y = 2x + 4 $$ and $$ y = 5 - 3x $$.
        </p>
        
        <p>TODO: plotting two lines</p>
        
        <p>
          To makes things simpler, we normally rearrange linear equations so that one side is zero.
          For instance, if we have the equation $$ 2x + 4 = 5 - 3x $$, we can
          rearrange it to $$ 5x - 1 = 0 $$. As before, we can plot both sides
          of the equation, with the solution being the x coordinate where
          the lines meet. Since one side of the equation is zero, one of the lines
          we plot is $$ y = 0 $$, which is the same as the x-axis. Therefore,
          our solution is the $$ x $$ coordinate where $$ y = 5x - 1 $$ meets the x-axis.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In general, if we rearrange an equation so that one of the sides is zero,
          the solution is the $$ x $$ coordinate where the left-hand side meets the x-axis.
